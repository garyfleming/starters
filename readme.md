# How to add a new language

We'd appreciate any new language that you can provide. To do this:

- Create a new folder under `available` and add your source tree.
- Make sure a `runTests.sh` exists in your new folder
  - Assume the standard tools are already installed for the language
  - The programme shouldn't watch, it should run and exist cleanly
  - The user shouldn't have to do anything else to make the script pass
- Add the language in `supported.tsx`

And to test it...

- Add the language to `supported` in `endToEndTest.sh`
- Add any required tooling to the `Dockerfile`. The tests run inside this Docker container
- Run the `endToEndTest.sh` and make sure it finishes
